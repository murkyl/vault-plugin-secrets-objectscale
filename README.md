# ObjectScale secrets plugin for Hashicorp Vault
This plug in will manage IAM dynamic access key ID and secrets for accessing ObjectScale S3 buckets.

## How it works
This plugin has 2 modes of operation for generating credentials.
1. Dynamic mode
2. Predefined mode

In the dynamic mode, the plugin dynamically creates users in a namespace and assigns policies, groups, and permission boundaries.

To access the dynamic mode the Vault paths are `roles/dynamic/<role_name>` and `creds/dynamic/<role_name>`

In the predefined mode, the plugin system is only responsible for rotating the access key and secret of a user. The user is assumed to already exist.

To access the predefined mode the Vault paths are `roles/predefined/<user_name>` and `creds/predefined/<user_name>`

## Installation
A secrets engine plugin must be setup and configured before it can be used. Follow the directions below to properly install and configure the plugin.

### General ObjectScale configuration
1) A management account must exist for that will be used by the plugin.
2) Policies, groups, and permission boundaries that are to be configured for a role must already exist in the System namespace or the specific namespace used in the role.

## Dynamic mode
In this mode, a user is dynamically created and deleted as determined by a TTL value and policies, groups, tags, and a permission boundary can be applied to the created user. Credentials for this user will be returned for use to access resources of the cluster.

## Predefined mode
In this mode the plugin only handles creating S3 access secrets that expire within the defined TTL values. The user is expected to already exist in the namespace configured in the role. In ObjectScale a user can have up to 2 access keys active at any one time. These access keys are predetermined for a user at user creation time and do not change so the plugin can only invalidate the secrets for a user and not the access key as well. When in the predefined mode the user that is configured should only have access keys managed by the plugin and not manually via the management console. Manually created access keys will get cleaned up by the plugin and having 2 access keys will prevent the STS/role assumption from working properly.

No additional cluster configuration is required for this mode.

## Vault Plugin

### Using pre-built releases (recommended)
Any binary releases available can be found [here](https://github.com/murkyl/vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale/releases).

### From source
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine and run `make build` from the root of the sources directory. After successful compilation the resulting `vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale` binary is located in the `bin/` directory.

Building from source assumes you have installed the Go development environment. The instructions and Makefile are developed for Linux based systems. Adjust the instructions according to your platform.

### Registering the plugin
Before a Vault plugin can be used, it must be copied to the Vault plugins directory and registered. The plugin directory for Vault is located in the Vault configuration file, often located at `/etc/vault.d/vault.hcl`.

Details of the Vault configuration file can be found in the [Vault online docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration "docs").

The required settings for registering a plugin are `plugin_directory` and `api_addr`. These need to be set according to your environment.

After copying the binary into the plugin directory, make sure that the permissions on the binary allow the Vault server process to execute it. Sometimes this means changing the ownership and group of the plugin to the Vault POSIX user account, for example chown vault:vault and a chmod 750. On a Windows platform make sure the binary ends with the .exe extension.

Make sure the Vault server itself is running, unsealed, and your have logged into Vault before registering the plugin.

Plugins also need to be registered with the Vault server [plugin catalog](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/plugins.html#plugin-catalog) before they can be enabled. A SHA256 sum of the binary is required in the register command.

```shell
vault plugin register \
  -sha256=$(sha256sum /etc/vault.d/vault_plugins/vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale_vX.Y.Z | cut -d " " -f 1) \
  -command vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale_vX.Y.Z \
  secret vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale
```

The -command option can be skipped and the default of the plugin name will be used as the executable. It is easier to always use the -command value to point to a specific version of the plugin executable.

You may see a warning in your Vault logs similar to this:
```shell
[WARN]  secrets.vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale.vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale_f798c167.vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale: plugin failed to exit gracefully: metadata=true
```
This warning is expected and can be safely ignored.

### Upgrading the plugin
[Upgrading a plugin](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/upgrading/plugins) and keeping the existing configuration requires some specific steps. The procedure is similar to registering the plugin for the first time.

1) Ensure the current plugin is already registered, enabled, and mounted to a path
2) Copy the new binary to the plugin directory
3) Generate the SHA256 hash of the new binary
4) Register the new binary with the old plugin name
5) Ask Vault to reload the plugin

```shell
vault plugin register \
  -sha256=$(sha256sum /etc/vault.d/vault_plugins/vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale_vX.Y.Z | cut -d " " -f 1) \
  -command vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale_vA.B.C \
  secret vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale

vault plugin reload -plugin vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale
```

### Enabling the plugin
After the plugin is registered you can enable the plugin and have it available on a mount path.

```shell
vault secrets enable -path=objectscale vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale
```

You may see a warning in your Vault logs similar to this:
```shell
[WARN]  secrets.vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale.vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale_f798c167.vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale: plugin failed to exit gracefully: metadata=true
```
This warning is expected and can be safely ignored.

### Plugin configuration
To configure the plugin you need to write a set of key/value pairs to the path /config/root off of your plugin mount point. These configuration values should be written as key value pairs. Only 3 values are mandatory while the remainder have defaults. See the [available options](#path-configroot) below for additional customization. The configuration below assumes defaults are used. The user and password need to be a management or namespace user.

```shell
vault write objectscale/config/root \
    user="vault_mgr" \
    password="isasecret" \
    endpoint="https://cluster.com:4443"
```

## Dynamic mode usage
Normal use involves creating roles that associate local groups to the role and then retrieving the credentials for that role. The roles and credential paths need to be secured via ACLs in Vault itself as the plugin does not perform any authentication or access control. Any request that reaches the plugin is assumed to have permission to do so from Vault.

### Create a role in Vault that will apply a set of policies to a user
This plugin role will associate policies, groups, tags, and boundary permissions to a dynamically created user. Only the namespace parameter is required however not providing a policy or group results in a created user with no permissions. Replace VaultRoleName with the name of the role you want to create.

```shell
vault write objectscale/roles/dynamic/VaultRoleName namespace="somenamespace" policy=iampolicy1
vault write objectscale/roles/dynamic/VaultRoleName2 namespace="somenamespace" policy=usernamespace:useriampolicy1
```

The namespace is required when defining a role. See the [available options](#path-rolesdynamicrole_name) below for additional customization.

### Retrieve a credential with the default TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/dynamic/VaultRoleName
```

### Retrieve a credential with an unlimited TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/dynamic/VaultRoleName ttl=-1
```

### Retrieve a credential with a TTL of 180 seconds
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/dynamic/VaultRoleName ttl=180
```
In dynamic mode, repeated calls to read the objectscale/creds/dynamic/`role_name` path will each return a new access ID and secret pair.

### Credential expiration and cleanup
By default the plugin will provide an access token and secret that has an expiration of 300 seconds (5 minutes). The plugin creates a user name that looks like `vault_4xzkHE_7090_20210826133755`. The name begins with the **username_prefix** followed by a 6 character random string. It is followed by the first 4 characters of the Vault request UUID and then finally a time stamp. For credentials that expire, this timestamp represents the local time that the credential will become invalid.

If a credential with an unlimited duration is requested the user name will be in the format `vault_4xzkHE_7090_INF_20210826133755`. The extra string `INF` is added before the timestamp. The timestamp in this situation represents the time the credential was created instead of when it will expire.

The dynamically generated users will periodically be cleaned up by the plugin. The frequency that this occurs is determined by the `cleanup_period` option. The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes). Credentials that expire in between the cleanup periods will not be deleted until the next cleanup period occurs. A cleanup period check happens every minute from when the plugin is enabled. Internally the cleanup schedule is fixed at an interval of the cleanup period. For an example, if the plugin is started at 09:28, then the next cleanup periods will be 09:30, 09:40, 09:50, etc. If the cleanup period is 1 hour and the plugin is started at 09:28, the next cleanup will occur at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, etc.

## Predefined mode usage
Normal use involves creating roles that represent a user's user name and then automatically expiring secrets.

### Create the role
A user needs to have a role created for them before they are allowed to retrieve a credential. This role should have a Vault access policy only allowing the specified user to access this particular path. Failure to do so could result in a user prematurely invalidating another user's credentials and also reading another user's credentials.

```shell
vault write objectscale/roles/predefined/user1 namespace="somenamespace"
vault write objectscale/roles/predefined/user1 namespace="somenamespace" ttl=600 policy=iampolicy1
vault write objectscale/roles/predefined/user1 namespace="somenamespace" ttl=600 policy=usernamespace:iampolicy1
```

Attempts to configure a role where the user does not exist will succeed. However, when a credential is requested an error will be returned.

When using the CLI vault command to create a predefined role with all defaults you must use the -force option or provide some parameter.

### Retrieve a credential with the default TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/predefined/user1
```

### Retrieve a credential with an unlimited TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/predefined/user1 ttl=-1
```

### Retrieve a credential with a TTL of 180 seconds
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/predefined/user1 ttl=180
```

## Predefined STS/IAM role assumption usage
The plugin supports returning credentials for a user assuming a role. The configuration is simple and only requires that the the user have a role configured as per the normal predefined mode usage. When retrieving the elevated privileges the plugin will automatically create a temporary set of Access ID and secrets for the user, use the new credentials to retrieve the elevated privileges, and then delete the temporary credentials.

Retrieving elevated credentials requires knowing the ARN for the role that is to be assumed by the user. This ARN needs to be passed into the call to the endpoint. The minimum duration for the elevated privileges is 3600 seconds. A longer duration can be requested during the credential request but the maximum is limited by the role itself.

The ARN for the role can be in the full form of: urn:ecs:iam::*__namespace__*:*__policy__* or a shortened form of *__namespace__*:*__policy__*. 

### Retrieve elevated role privileges
```shell
vault read oscale/sts/predefined/regularjoe role_arn=urn:ecs:iam::apj:role/upgradeJoe

### Specifying an invalid duration results in an error
```shell
vault read oscale/sts/predefined/regularjoe role_arn=apj:upgradeJoe duration=30000
Error reading oscale/sts/predefined/regularjoe: Error making API request.

```

## Security
HashiCorp Vault administrators are responsible for plugin security, including creating the Vault policy to ensure only authorized Hashicorp Vault users have access to the ObjectScale secrets plugin.

The following example creates a HashiCorp Vault policy and token restricted to generating access_id and secret keys for the predefined user account `user1`.
 

Contents of policy file /tmp/example_policy_file:
```
path "objectscale/creds/predefined/user1" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
```

Configure HashiCorp Vault policy and create new token:
```shell
vault policy write objectscale-predefined-readcred-user1 /tmp/example_policy_file
vault token create -policy=objectscale-predefined-readcred-user1
```
