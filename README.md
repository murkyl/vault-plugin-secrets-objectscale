# ObjectScale secrets plugin for Hashicorp Vault
This plug in will manage IAM dynamic access key ID and secrets for accessing ObjectScale S3 buckets.

## How it works
This plugin has 2 modes of operation for generating credentials.
1. Dynamic mode
2. Predefined mode

In the dynamic mode, the plugin dynamically creates users in a namespace and assigns policies, groups, and permission boundaries.

To access the dynamic mode the Vault paths are `roles/dynamic/<role_name>` and `creds/dynamic/<role_name>`

In the predefined mode, the plugin system is only responsible for rotating the access key and secret of a user. The user is assumed to already exist.

To access the predefined mode the Vault paths are `roles/predefined/<user_name>` and `creds/predefined/<user_name>`

## Installation
A secrets engine plugin must be setup and configured before it can be used. Follow the directions below to properly install and configure the plugin.

### General ObjectScale configuration
1) A management account must exist for that will be used by the plugin.
2) Policies, groups, and permission boundaries that are to be configured for a role must already exist in the System namespace or the specific namespace used in the role.

## Dynamic mode
In this mode, a user is dynamically created and deleted as determined by a TTL value and policies, groups, tags, and a permission boundary can be applied to the created user. Credentials for this user will be returned for use to access resources of the cluster.

## Predefined mode
In this mode the plugin only handles creating S3 access secrets that expire within the defined TTL values. The user is expected to already exist either locally on the cluster or in another authentication provider like Active Directory.

No additional cluster configuration is required for this mode.

## Vault Plugin

### Using pre-built releases (recommended)
Any binary releases available can be found [here](https://github.com/murkyl/vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale/releases).

### From source
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine and run `make build` from the root of the sources directory. After successful compilation the resulting `vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale` binary is located in the `bin/` directory.

Building from source assumes you have installed the Go development environment.

### Registering the plugin
Before a Vault plugin can be used, it must be copied to the Vault plugins directory and registered. The plugin directory for Vault is located in the Vault configuration file, often located at `/etc/vault.d/vault.hcl`.

Details of the Vault configuration file can be found in the [Vault online docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration "docs").

The required settings for registering a plugin are `plugin_directory` and `api_addr`. These need to be set according to your environment.

After copying the binary into the plugin directory, make sure that the permissions on the binary allow the Vault server process to execute it. Sometimes this means changing the ownership and group of the plugin to the Vault POSIX user account, for example chown vault:vault and a chmod 750.

Make sure the Vault server itself is running, unsealed, and your have logged into Vault before registering the plugin.

Plugins also need to be registered with the Vault server [plugin catalog](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/plugins.html#plugin-catalog) before they can be enabled. A SHA256 sum of the binary is required in the register command.

```shell
vault plugin register \
	-sha256=$(sha256sum /etc/vault.d/vault_plugins/vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale | cut -d " " -f 1) \
	secret vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale
```

### Enabling the plugin
After the plugin is registered you can enable the plugin and have it available on a mount path.

```shell
vault secrets enable -path=objectscale vault-plugin-secrets-objectscale
```

### Plugin configuration
To configure the plugin you need to write a set of key/value pairs to the path /config/root off of your plugin mount point. These configuration values should be written as key value pairs. Only 3 values are mandatory while the remainder have defaults. See the [available options](#path-configroot) below for additional customization. The configuration below assumes defaults are used.

### Dynamic mode
```shell
vault write objectscale/config/root \
    user="vault_mgr" \
    password="isasecret" \
    endpoint="https://cluster.com:4443"
```

#### Predefined mode
```shell
vault write objectscale/config/root \
    user="vault_mgr" \
    password="isasecret" \
    endpoint="https://cluster.com:4443"
```

## Dynamic mode usage
Normal use involves creating roles that associate local groups to the role and then retrieving the credentials for that role. The roles and credential paths need to be secured via ACLs in Vault itself as the plugin does not perform any authentication or access control. Any request that reaches the plugin is assumed to have permission to do so from Vault.

### Create a role in Vault that will apply a set of policies to a user
This plugin role will associate policies, groups, tags, and boundary permissions to a dynamically created user. Only the namespace parameter is required however not providing a policy or group results in a created user with no permissions.

```shell
vault write objectscale/roles/dynamic/Test1 namespace="somenamespace" policy=iampolicy1
```

The namespace is required when defining a role. See the [available options](#path-rolesdynamicrole_name) below for additional customization.

### Retrieve a credential with the default TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/dynamic/Test1
```

### Retrieve a credential with an unlimited TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/dynamic/Test1 ttl=-1
```

### Retrieve a credential with a TTL of 180 seconds
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/dynamic/Test1 ttl=180
```

### Credential expiration and cleanup
By default the plugin will provide an access token and secret that has an expiration of 300 seconds (5 minutes). The plugin creates a user name that looks like `vault_4xzkHE_7090_20210826133755`. The name begins with the **username_prefix** followed by a 6 character random string. It is followed by the first 4 characters of the Vault request UUID and then finally a time stamp. For credentials that expire, this timestamp represents the local time that the credential will become invalid.

If a credential with an unlimited duration is requested the user name will be in the format `vault_4xzkHE_7090_INF_20210826133755`. The extra string `INF` is added before the timestamp. The timestamp in this situation represents the time the credential was created instead of when it will expire.

The dynamically generated users will periodically be cleaned up by the plugin. The frequency that this occurs is determined by the `cleanup_period` option. The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes). Credentials that expire in between the cleanup periods will not be deleted until the next cleanup period occurs. A cleanup period check happens every minute from when the plugin is enabled. Internally the cleanup schedule is fixed at an interval of the cleanup period. For an example, if the plugin is started at 09:28, then the next cleanup periods will be 09:30, 09:40, 09:50, etc. If the cleanup period is 1 hour and the plugin is started at 09:28, the next cleanup will occur at 10:00, 11:00, 12:00, etc.

## Predefined mode usage
Normal use involves creating roles that represent a user's user name and then automatically expiring access key and secrets.

### Create the role
A user needs to have a role created for them before they are allowed to retrieve a credential. This role should have a Vault access policy only allowing the specified user to access this particular path. Failure to do so could result in a user prematurely invalidating another user's credentials and also reading another user's credentials.

```shell
vault write objectscale/roles/predefined/user1 namespace="somenamespace"
vault write objectscale/roles/predefined/user1 namespace="somenamespace" ttl=600
```

Attempts to configure a role where the user does not exist will succeed. However, when a credential is requested an error will be returned.

When using the CLI vault command to create a predefined role with all defaults you must use the -force option or provide some parameter.

### Retrieve a credential with the default TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/predefined/user1
```

### Retrieve a credential with an unlimited TTL
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/predefined/user1 ttl=-1
```

### Retrieve a credential with a TTL of 180 seconds
```shell
vault read objectscale/creds/predefined/user1 ttl=180
```

## Security
HashiCorp Vault administrators are responsible for plugin security, including creating the Vault policy to ensure only authorized Hashicorp Vault users have access to the ObjectScale secrets plugin.

The following example creates a HashiCorp Vault policy and token restricted to generating access_id and secret keys for the predefined user account `user1`.
 

Contents of policy file /tmp/example_policy_file:
```
path "objectscale/creds/predefined/user1" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}
```

Configure HashiCorp Vault policy and create new token:
```shell
vault policy write objectscale-predefined-readcred-user1 /tmp/example_policy_file
vault token create -policy=objectscale-predefined-readcred-user1
```
